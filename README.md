This is my first game/project for General Assembly. I present to you...

Cage Match!

Two Nicolas Cage's enter the arena, one leaves!

Who will survive the Cage?

The Game:
https://jbonez87.github.io/game-to-make/

Built with HTML, CSS and ES6 Javascript

9/2/2016- I'm running into a lot of problems getting the functionality for
the attack functions. I realized there was no point in making a separate opponent
class. That doesn't work with this game because the player class can't call
the opponent class when I try to reduce the opponent's hit points. I'm keeping the
opponent.js purely for a record of stuff I tried. I decided to make the player.js
a fighter.js. Opponent and player have basically the same abilities.


9/3/16 - I'm trying to make a health bar appear over the fighters. I managed
to create one but I'm having trouble getting it to render damage to either the
fighter or the opponent.

9/5/16 - I gave up on the healthbar and decided on an h3 within the Nicolas
Cage divs instead.

Features I wish I could have made/improved on:
-I would've liked to have added sound effects and sprite renderings for the red
and blue cages.

-I also would've liked to have had actual health bars instead of a counter. I
will focus on this when I revisit this game.

-I want more practice separating the different classes. I was able to get this
game working with a single class, but I want to definitely refactor this.
