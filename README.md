This is my first game/project for General Assembly. I present to you...

Cage Match!

Two Nicolas Cage's enter the arena, one leaves!

Who will survive the Cage?

9/2/2016- I'm running into a lot of problems getting the functionality for
the attack functions. I realized there was no point in making a separate opponent
class. That doesn't work with this game because the player class can't call
the opponent class when I try to reduce the opponent's hit points. I'm keeping the
opponent.js purely for a record of stuff I tried. I decided to make the player.js
a fighter.js. Opponent and player have basically the same abilities.


9/3/16 - I'm trying to make a health bar appear over the fighters. I managed
to create one but I'm having trouble getting it to render damage to either the
fighter or the opponent.
